Singles-species file consists of:
  i. r-K logistic model, where b and d are linear functions of N
  ii. r-K logistic model, where b and d are non-linear functions of N

Two-species file consists of:
  i. r-K logistic model with mutualism, varying coefficients, N, and K
  ii.  a simple example of plotting a vector field with nullclines and some trajectories
